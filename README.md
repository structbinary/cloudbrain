# CloudBrain - Intelligent Agent System

**⚠️ OUTDATED: This project has been restructured to use the A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocol and MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers for enhanced flexibility and modularity.**

**New Architecture:**
- **MCP Servers**: All DevOps tool automation is now in [cloudbrain-mcp](https://github.com/structbinary/cloudbrain-mcp)
- **A2A Agents**: Multiple agents built on A2A protocol are in [cloudbrain-agents](https://github.com/structbinary/cloudbrain-agents)
- **This Repository**: Now this will only contains A2A client codebase which will be taken care once the mcp servers and a2a agents codebase is ready.
